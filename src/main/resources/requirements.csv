3.1;Product Description and Scope: The Digital Home system, for the purposes of this document, is a system that will allow a home user to manage devices that control the environment of a home. The user communicates through a personal web page on the DigitalHome web server or on a local home server. The Digital Home web server communicates, through a home wireless gateway device, with the sensor and controller devices in the home. The product is based on the Digital Home High Level Requirements Definition [HLRD 2010] is intended as a prototype, which will allow business decisions to be made about future development of a commercial product. The scope of the project will be limited to the management of devices which control temperature, humidity, security, and power to small appliances and lighting units, through the use of a web-ready device. The prototype Digital Home software system will be situated in a simulated environment. There will be no actual physical home and all sensors and controllers will be simulated;0
