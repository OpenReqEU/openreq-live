                        <p>Dear Students,</p>

                        <p>
                        welcome to the "Requirement Dependency Analyzation" task of assignment sheet 2 ("Ãœbungsblatt 2")!
                        In this task you have to identify dependencies between software requirements for the development of a "Smart
                        House", called DigitalHome (DH).  A "Smart House" is a home management system that allows
                        home residents to easily manage their daily lives by providing for a lifestyle that
                        brings together security, environmental and energy management (temperature,
                        humidity and lighting), entertainment, and communications.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        All software requirements of DH are defined and listed in the <a href="/upload/re_smarthome.pdf">PDF file</a> (<a href="/upload/re_smarthome.pdf" style="vertical-align:bottom;"><img src="/images/pdf_icon.svg" width="20" height="21" style="margin-right:8px;" />Download PDF</a>).
                        <div class="alert alert-danger or-alert">
                            Before you start with the identification of the dependencies between the requirements, please read the <a href="/upload/re_smarthome.pdf">PDF document</a> VERY CAREFULLY!<br />
                            Requirement dependencies can ONLY be identified correctly, after you completely understood the full content of the given PDF document.
                        </div>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        On the next page you find a list of requirement pairs which has to be analyzed by you.
                        Your task is to manually analyze the two requirements of each requirement pair individually and
                        then to classify whether there exists a dependency between the two different requirements or not.
                        The analyzation/classification of each pair should be done based on the descriptions of both requirements
                        and the background knowledge you gained when reading the PDF document.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Dependency types:</h2>
                        <p>
                        For every classified dependency you also have to specify the type of the dependency.
                        Thereby, you have to choose one of the following 4 different dependency types:
                        <ul class="or-explanation-list">
                            <li>
                                <b>REQUIRES dependency:</b><br />
                                x REQUIRES y: For the implementation of the Requirement x, Requirement y needs to be implemented first.
                                <b>Attention:</b> A REQUIRES DEPENDENCY is always <i>unidirectional</i>, that means (x REQUIRES y) is NOT the same as (y REQUIRES x).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>EXCLUDES dependency:</b><br />
                                x EXCLUDES y: Requirement x and requirement y can not implemented in the same release, which means that the implementation of x forbids the implementation of y and vice versa.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>IS SIMILAR TO dependency:</b><br />
                                Rx IS SIMILAR TO Ry: Both Requirements are similar or related to each other based on their descriptions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>IS PART OF dependency:</b><br />
                                x IS PART OF y: Requirement x is a part of requirement y means that y includes x.
                                This can also be interpreted as follow: x is child/subrequirement of y, whereby y can have several children/subrequirements.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Examples for dependency types:</h2>
                        <p>
                            To understand the meaning of the 4 given dependency types a demonstrative example is provided.
                            Consider the following subset of requirements for the development of a sportswatch:<br />
                            <u>Requirement a:</u> For statistical purposes, a distance measurement is necessary.<br />
                            <u>Requirement b:</u> The average length of steps are required.<br />
                            <u>Requirement c:</u> Number of steps have to be measured with a pedometer.<br />
                            <u>Requirement d:</u> The sportswatch should only be based on iOS.<br />
                            <u>Requirement e:</u> The sportswatch should only be based on Android.<br />
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <u>Dependencies of <i>unidirectional</i> type <b>REQUIRES</b>:</u><br />
                            Requirement <b>a</b> REQUIRES requirement <b>b</b><br />
                            Requirement <b>a</b> REQUIRES requirement <b>c</b><br /><br />
                            <u>Reason:</u> <i>in order to implement requirement a requirement b must be implemented first
                            because for the calculation of the distance the average length of steps is needed (i.e., a REQUIRES b).
                            Also, the number of steps must be measured as well to compute the distance (i.e., a REQUIRES c).</i><br /><br />
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Requirement <b>c</b> IS PART OF requirement <b>a</b><br />
                            Requirement <b>b</b> IS PART OF requirement <b>a</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <u>Dependencies of <i>bidirectional</i> type <b>EXCLUDES</b>:</u><br />
                            Requirement <b>d</b> EXCLUDES requirement <b>e</b> (is equivalent to <b>e</b> EXCLUDES <b>d</b>, because it's a <i>bidirectional</i> dependency)<br />
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <u>Dependencies of <i>bidirectional</i> type <b>IS SIMILAR TO</b>:</u><br />
                            Requirement <b>b</b> IS SIMILAR TO requirement <b>a</b> (is equivalent to <b>a</b> IS SIMILAR TO <b>b</b>, because it's a <i>bidirectional</i> dependency)<br />
                        </p>
